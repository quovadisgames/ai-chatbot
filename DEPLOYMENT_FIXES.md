# Deployment Fixes for Type Compatibility Issues

This guide addresses the type compatibility issues encountered during deployment on Vercel, specifically related to the `Message` type from the `ai` package.

## Issue Summary

The build error occurred because of a type mismatch between:
- The `Message` type defined in the `ai` package (version 4.1.44), which only allows `'user' | 'assistant' | 'system' | 'data'` for the `role` property
- Our application's message type, which includes additional roles like `'function'` and `'tool'`

## Applied Fixes

We've made the following changes to resolve the type compatibility issues:

1. **Removed direct dependency on the `Message` type from the `ai` package**:
   - Created a local `LocalMessage` type with our extended role options
   - Defined a separate `AIMessage` type that matches the `ai` package's requirements

2. **Updated type handling in the chat API route**:
   - Modified the `POST` function to accept `any[]` for incoming messages
   - Added proper type conversion when passing messages to the AI functions
   - Updated the `getMostRecentUserMessage` function to accept `any[]`

3. **Implemented role mapping**:
   - Added logic to map `'function'` and `'tool'` roles to `'assistant'` when converting to the AI package's expected format

## Deployment Steps

1. **Push the changes to your repository**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix type compatibility issues for Vercel deployment"
   git push
   ```

2. **Redeploy on Vercel**:
   - Go to your Vercel dashboard
   - Select your project
   - Trigger a new deployment (or it will automatically deploy if you've set up auto-deployments)

3. **Verify the build**:
   - Monitor the build logs to ensure there are no type errors
   - Test the application functionality after deployment

## Additional Notes

- These changes maintain compatibility with the `ai` package while allowing our application to use extended message roles internally
- The type conversion approach is more robust than trying to modify the package's types directly
- This solution avoids the need to downgrade or modify dependencies

If you encounter any other type compatibility issues during deployment, follow a similar approach:
1. Identify the specific type mismatch
2. Create local type definitions if needed
3. Implement proper type conversion at the boundaries where external packages are used
